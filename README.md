# mini_notes

mini_notes is a small desktop application for taking quick technical notes in a clearer and more visual way than a plain text editor. I wanted something extremely simple, but still useful for highlighting important information while I work or study.

The project started as a personal tool while I was exploring new development techniques in Python. I often take notes about PowerShell, commands, and small experiments, so I wanted a lightweight space where I could use color to distinguish ideas, commands, or key fragments at a glance. The color choices and font inspiration come partly from the way I naturally organize information when working in PowerShell.

## Features
- Lightweight text editor
- Five quick text color options
- Save and load notes
- Custom application icon
- Minimal and distraction‑free interface

## Project status
**Work in progress.**  
I use this tool daily and improve it gradually as I refine my workflow.

## How to run
1. Create a virtual environment:
-  python -m venv venv

2. Activate it:
- Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
3. Run the application:
-  python notes.py


## Future improvements
- Better code organization
- Additional formatting options
- Dark mode
- Export notes
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., Ctrl+S to save)
- Context menu actions (right‑click to apply text colors or formatting)
- More flexible font controls (currently supports Ctrl + / Ctrl -)
