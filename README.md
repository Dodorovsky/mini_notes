# mini_notes

**mini_notes** is a lightweight desktop application for taking quick technical notes in a clearer and more visual way than a plain text editor.  
It was born as a personal tool while experimenting with Python UI development, and it has grown into a small but reliable companion for daily work and study.

I often take notes about PowerShell, commands, and small experiments, so I wanted a minimal space where I could use color to distinguish ideas, commands, or key fragments at a glance.  
The color palette and font inspiration come partly from how I naturally organize information when working in PowerShell.
